                        <p>
                            This site which you are viewing now that allows for calling through the web browser is considered
                            a softphone. We have decided to go with the softphone option instead of its counter part, a physical
                            phone on your desk because we are beyond that now. Who wants or needs to pay for an actual phone when
                            you can do all of the same things on your computer? The attached video gives more information about a
                            softphone is. Please feel free to contact us with any questions about how the system works. More videos
                            will be coming, specific to the various capabilities that we provide from SmartWire.
